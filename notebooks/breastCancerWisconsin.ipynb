    "# Exploring Dimlp and Fidex rule generation for breast cancer classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to HES-Xplain, our interactive platform designed to facilitate explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. In this use case, we dive into breast cancer classification and showcase the power of Dimlp and Fidex as interpretability tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the medical field, there are many machine-learning models that can obtain results. These models are like black boxes that return results without fully understanding the reasoning leading to them. Depending on the nature of the problem it's important to understand the model's decision. It's difficult for a doctor or a patient to make a decision based on a model that we don't understand. Likewise, insurance companies will not necessarily agree to pay for a medication that a model has advised people to take. This is why explainability in this field is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fidex is an algorithm used in classification problems that allows us to obtain a rule explaining the decision class of the model for a given test sample. It enables us to grasp the model's decision-making process and to better understand the importance of each parameter in discerning the nature of the tumor, distinguishing between benign and malignant cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The global version of Fidex, FidexGlo, allows us to get a set of rules that englobes all the decision-making process for the entire training set. We can then check if a new sample verifies all the properties of one rule of the ruleset, in which case this rule explains the model's decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to demonstrate how HES-Xplain empowers users to explore and interpret breast cancer classification effectively. By the end of this use case, you'll have a solid understanding of how to use Dimlp to train the model and the Fidex algorithms into your own classification datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Understand the importance of interpretability in medical problems.\n",
    "    2. Introduce Dimlp and Fidex as powerful XAI techniques.\n",
    "    3. Understand how to use Dimlp and Fidex.\n",
    "    4. Showcase the capabilities of HES-Xplain in implementing Dimlp and Fidex algorithms.\n",
    "    5. Provide practical insights into applying Dimlp and Fidex to breast cancer classifiers through an interactive notebook.\n",
    "    6. Foster a community of XAI enthusiasts and practitioners.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outline:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Dataset and Problem Statement.\n",
    "    2. Load the dataset.\n",
    "    3. Training of the Model.\n",
    "    4. Local rules generation - Fidex\n",
    "    5. Global ruleSet generation - FidexGlo\n",
    "    6. Conclusion.\n",
    "    7. References.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this use case, we aim to empower users to grasp the potential of Dimlp and Fidex as tools for transparent and interpretable classification. With HES-Xplain, we make XAI accessible, helping users build trust in their models and make informed decisions.\n"

    "# Dataset and Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The Breast Cancer Dataset used in this use case consists of 569 data samples representing patients who have tumors. Each patient has 30 attributes, computed out of an image, used to determine if the tumor is malignant (first class) or benign (second class). This dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) and can be imported with sklearn. It is composed of 455 training samples and 114 testing samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 30 attributes are composed of 10 real-valued features computed for each cell nucleus :\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Radius**: Mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter.\n",
    "- **Texture**: Standard deviation of gray-scale values.\n",
    "- **Perimeter**\n",
    "- **Area**\n",
    "- **Smoothness**: Local variation in radius lengths.\n",
    "- **Compactness**: $\\frac{\\text{perimeter}^2}{\\text{area}} - 1.0$\n",
    "- **Concavity**: Severity of concave portions of the contour.\n",
    "- **Concave Points**: Number of concave portions of the contour.\n",
    "- **Symmetry**\n",
    "- **Fractal Dimension**: \"Coastline approximation\" - 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each tumor image, the mean, standard error, and worst errors were computed and appear as different attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement:** Our objective is to build a robust classifier capable of accurately classifying breast cancer samples among the 2 classes. By leveraging deep learning techniques and Fidex algorithms, we aim to not only achieve high classification performance but also gain insights into the attributes that contribute to the classification decisions."

    "Here you can see the global statistics on the test set. As the previous calculations have randomness, each execution is a bit different. So here we will discuss the same case as before, so you may have slightly different results. In our case, we had about 98% fidelity, which is good, and a rule accuracy(96.5%) about 1.5% lower than the model accuracy(98%). So the rules seem to classify a bit worse. The explainability rate is the percentage of samples for which we can find a rule in the rules set. For the others, we need to execute Fidex (this is the default rule rate). In our case, we had more than a 97% explainability rate, so only in 3% of cases do we need to compute Fidex. Each rule can activate many rules. Here on average, a sample activates 5 correct rules and 0.05 wrong rules. A wrong rule is a rule with which the model doesn't agree. For example, if the rule says malign and the model says benign. Something interesting is the model test accuracy when rules and model agree. You can see that, generally, the accuracy increases if we consider samples where rules and model agree, and increases even more if we take only the activated rules (when there are no activated rules, we choose the model prediction). That means that the rules confirm well the model decision, but when no rule is found, the model decision may as well be wrong. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have the statistics on the positive/negative decisions of the model and of the rules. For the model's decisions, we had 1% false positives and 7% false negatives. That means that when the model says that it's malign, it has a 99% chance of being malign. But when it says that it's benign, there is a 7% risk that it is malign in reality. So the precision is 97% and the recall is 93%.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the rules decisions, the rules decision is the same as the model if we find a correct rule. If there is no rule, we can launch Fidex, so it's also the same decision as the model because it will create a fidel rule. The only scenario when the decision changes from the model's is when some rules are activated, all rules decide the same class which is not the class chosen by the model. The results are really close with 95% of precision and 93% of recall."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, we've learned how to use DimlpBT to train a dataset and get some explaining rules, and we got into the different Fidex algorithms to get some local and global explanations, and some statistics on the model's decisions. We used the example of the breast cancer dataset from Wisconsin and we saw that the algorithms perform very well. It gives some good explanations of the model's decision and does it very fast, especially if a fidexGlo ruleset has been computed beforehand. You can try with any tabular dataset you want, you just have to remember to transform the data in a good format. <be>\n",
    "\n",
    "We didn't speak about every single parameter, you can try to change every hyperparameter you want to see how it goes. An interesting parameter that we didn't consider is the parameter for decision threshold (--decision_threshold) in Fidex algorithms. It allows us to change prediction with respect to a specific threshold on the positive class. If the model gives a score prediction, for the positive class, greater than this threshold, the model prediction is considered to be the positive class, even if another class obtains a higher score. If the recall is not good enough, it's possible to improve it this way. Another parameter is the seed. It allows you to remove the randomness of the algorithms and get the same result in each execution for the same parameters and data.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We considered only a simple tabular dataset. It's also possible to use it for an image classification problem. To see how we can train a dataset with convolutions, we recommend exploring the Mnist notebook for a hands-on experience **Insérer lien notebook Mnist**. There are also other training methods, like an MLP or decision trees. The Keel Australian notebook goes through these and shows what to do when we have categorical attributes **Insérer Keel Australian notebook**."
