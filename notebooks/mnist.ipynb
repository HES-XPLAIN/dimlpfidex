    "We have about **97% fidelity**, which is good, and a **rule accuracy(96.6%)** about 3% lower than the **model accuracy(99.3%)**. So the rules seem to classify a bit worse. We have more than a **95% explainability rate**, so only in 5% of cases do we need to compute Fidex to get a rule. Each sample can activate many rules. Here on average, a sample activates **8 correct rules** and **0.2 wrong rules**. A wrong rule is a rule with which the model doesn't agree. For example, if the rule says 1 and the model says 2. Something interesting is the `model test accuracy when rules and model agree`. You can see that, generally, the accuracy increases if we consider samples where rules and model agree, and increases even more if we take only the activated rules (when there are no activated rules, we choose the model prediction). That means that the rules confirm well the model decision, but when no rule is found, the model decision may as well be wrong. <br>"

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explored explainable AI using CNNs and the Fidex family of algorithms. We looked at our dataset, trained a CNN model, and examined the generated rules. We used `Fidex` to create a local rule for a given sample explanation and `FidexGloRules` to generate a global ruleset for the entire training dataset. Then, we evaluated the ruleset with `FidexGloStats`, providing insights into the model's accuracy, fidelity, and explainability. Finally, we generated some explications with `FidexGlo` and observed the rule directly on the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process demonstrated how explainable AI techniques can clarify complex models, making them more transparent and trustworthy. By understanding our model's decision-making process, we can ensure better, more reliable outcomes in various applications. Using CNNs with Fidex offers a balanced approach to building interpretable and effective AI models and it is possible to obtain explanations on any image dataset you want.\n",
