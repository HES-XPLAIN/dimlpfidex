    "- `Positive index class`: This value means which class is considered as the positive one. If no threshold is used, this cannot be used, like in this case.\n",
    "- `Global rule fidelity rate`: Expressing whether the ruleset accurately reflects the model's predictions.\n",
    "- `Global rule accuracy`: Proportion of correct predictions made by the ruleset.\n",
    "- `Explainability rate`: Proportion of the samples that could be explained by one or more rules.\n",
    "- `Default rule rate`: Proportion of samples that could not be explained by a rule offered by the ruleset.\n",
    "- `Mean number of correct activated rules`: Average number of correct rules activated per sample.\n",
    "- `Mean number of wrong activated rules`: Average number of incorrect rules activated per sample.\n",
    "- `Model test accuracy`: Accuracy of the model on the test dataset\n",
    "- `Model test accuracy when rules agree`: Accuracy of the model on test samples where the ruleset and model predictions agree.\n",
    "- `Model test accuracy when activated rules agree`: Accuracy when at least one activated rule agrees with the model's prediction.\n",

    "With this program, you can have a general overview of the quality of the ruleset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have about **97% fidelity**, which is good, and a **rule accuracy(96.6%)** about 3% lower than the **model accuracy(99.3%)**. So the rules seem to classify a bit worse. We have more than a **95% explainability rate**, so only in 5% of cases do we need to compute Fidex to get a rule. Each sample can activate many rules. Here on average, a sample activates **8 correct rules** and **0.2 wrong rules**. A wrong rule is a rule with which the model doesn't agree. For example, if the rule says 1 and the model says 2. Something interesting is the `model test accuracy when rules and model agree`. You can see that, generally, the accuracy increases if we consider samples where rules and model agree, and increases even more if we take only the activated rules (when there are no activated rules, we choose the model prediction). That means that the rules confirm well the model decision, but when no rule is found, the model decision may as well be wrong. <br>"

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explored explainable AI using CNNs and the Fidex family of algorithms. We looked at our dataset, trained a CNN model, and examined the generated rules. We used `Fidex` to create a local rule for a given sample explanation and `FidexGloRules` to generate a global ruleset for the entire training dataset. Then, we evaluated the ruleset with `FidexGloStats`, providing insights into the model's accuracy, fidelity, and explainability. Finally, we generated some explications with `FidexGlo` and observed the rule directly on the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process demonstrated how explainable AI techniques can clarify complex models, making them more transparent and trustworthy. By understanding our model's decision-making process, we can ensure better, more reliable outcomes in various applications. Using CNNs with Fidex offers a balanced approach to building interpretable and effective AI models and it is possible to obtain explanations on any image dataset you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "To go further, you can explore the notebook on the Cracks dataset which is another application of CNNs on image classification [TODO: INSERER LIEN NOTEBOOK CRACKS]."
