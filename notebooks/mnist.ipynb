    "\n",
    "**Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Observe a different use case where XAI can be used.\n",

    "# Dataset and Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The MNIST Dataset used in this use case consists of 60'000 data samples representing images of digits between 0 and 9. Each image sample has 784 attributes (shape 28x28x1). This dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv). We already preprocessed the data and saved it in the `data/MnistDataset` folder. It is composed of 50'000 training samples and 10'000 testing samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each attribute is a pixel value ranging from 0 to 255. It's not necessary to normalize the data as it is done during the CNN training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement:** Our objective is to build a robust CNN classifier capable of accurately classifying the images among the 10 classes. By leveraging deep learning techniques and Fidex algorithms, we aim to not only achieve high classification performance but also gain insights into the attributes that contribute to the classification decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by importing all libraries. A warning might appear, but there's no need to worry about it."

    "Here you can see the global statistics on the test set. We have about 97% fidelity, which is good, and a rule accuracy(96.6%) about 3% lower than the model accuracy(99.3%). So the rules seem to classify a bit worse. The explainability rate is the percentage of samples for which we can find a rule in the rules set. For the others, we need to execute Fidex (this is the default rule rate). In our case, we had more than a 95% explainability rate, so only in 5% of cases do we need to compute Fidex. Each rule can activate many rules. Here on average, a sample activates 8 correct rules and 0.2 wrong rules. A wrong rule is a rule with which the model doesn't agree. For example, if the rule says malign and the model says benign. Something interesting is the model test accuracy when rules and model agree. You can see that, generally, the accuracy increases if we consider samples where rules and model agree, and increases even more if we take only the activated rules (when there are no activated rules, we choose the model prediction). That means that the rules confirm well the model decision, but when no rule is found, the model decision may as well be wrong. <br>"

    "Throughout this notebook, we've learned how to use cnnTrn to train a dataset and get some explaining rules, and we got into the different Fidex algorithms to get some local and global explanations, and some statistics on the model's decisions. We used the example of the MNIST dataset and we saw that the algorithms perform very well. It gives some good explanations of the model's decision. You can try with any image dataset you want, you just have to remember to transform the data in a proper format. <be>\n",
    "\n",
    "We didn't speak about every single parameter, you can try to change every hyperparameter you want to see how it goes. A parameter that can be useful is the seed. It allows you to remove the randomness of the algorithms and get the same result in each execution for the same parameters and data.<br>\n",
