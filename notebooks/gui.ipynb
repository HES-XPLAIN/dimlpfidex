For our demonstration, let's choose the directory containing our files: `data/GUIDataset/`. Although the field appears optional, it's recommended to specify the `Root folder` to avoid path errors. Otherwise, provide complete paths for all required files.\n",

    "\n",
    "9. Designate the `number of attributes` and `number of classes` in the dataset. Since our dataset has **38 columns**, with **31 as attributes** and **7 as classes**, specify **31** for attributes and **7** for classes.\n",

    "10. For the `Test prediction file`, enter `dimlp_test.out`.\n",
