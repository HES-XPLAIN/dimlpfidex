    "\n",
    "JSON is a lightweight data format commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a web application. It is both human-readable and machine-readable, making it easy for developers to work with. JSON consists of key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects. Here's a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n",
    "  \"age\": 30,\n",
    "  \"city\": \"New York\",\n",
    "  \"email\": \"john@example.com\",\n",
    "  \"pets\": [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"type\": \"dog\",\n",
    "      \"name\": \"Buddy\"\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"type\": \"cat\",\n",
    "      \"name\": \"Whiskers\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we have a JSON object representing information about a person named `John Doe`. The object contains key-value pairs such as `name`, `age`, `city`, and `email`, providing details about the person's identity. Additionally, there is an array called `pets`, which contains objects representing details about each pet owned by `John Doe`. Each `pet` object includes properties like `type` (specifying the type of pet) and `name` (the name of the pet). This example demonstrates how JSON can organize structured data, making it easy to manage and exchange information between different systems.\n",
