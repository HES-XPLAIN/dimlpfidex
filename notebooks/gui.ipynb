JSON is a lightweight data format commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a web application. It is both human-readable and machine-readable, making it easy for developers to work with. JSON consists of key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects. Here's a simple example:"

The object contains key-value pairs such as \"name\", \"age\", \"city\", and \"email\", providing details about the person's identity. Additionally, there is an array called \"pets\", which contains objects representing details about each pet owned by John Doe. Each pet object includes properties like \"type\" (specifying the type of pet) and \"name\" (the name of the pet). This example demonstrates how JSON can organize structured data, making it easy to manage and exchange information between different systems.\n",

As you can see, there's a lot of things going on here. In this case, most of it are numeric values to tweak the behaviour of the algorithm itself and the other part are file paths that contain necessary data to feed the algorithm and thereby make it work for us. In this section, we'll not dive into parameters details, this will be detailed inside our dedicated documentation: **LINK TO DOC**.\n",
