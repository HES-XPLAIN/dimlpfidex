This was a pain sometimes, espacially when you're dealing directly with program binaries. This is because, to use one of them, you have to open a command line interface and type the name of the program followed by a couple of arguments (could be 5, 10 or even 24 like the examples shown below). This could lead to command lines like this one:  "
